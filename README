1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
ans: var can be redeclared and updated, let can be updated but not redeclared in the same scope, cannot be reassigned but objects/arrays declared with const can still have their contents changed.
2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?
ans:map(), returns a new array with transformed values. forEach(), executes a function but does not return a new array, filter(), returns a new array with only the elements that pass a condition.
3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
ans: const add = (a, b) => a + b;
4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
ans:

example-1
const [x, y] = [10, 20];
console.log(x); // 10
console.log(y); // 20


example-2
const person = { name: "Maimuna", age: 23 };
const { name, age } = person;
console.log(name); // "Maimuna"
console.log(age);  // 22

5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
ans:
const name = "Maimuna";
const msg = `Hello ${name}, 

Difference:
1. Concatenation: `"Hello " + name + "!"`
2. Template literal: `Hello ${name}!`
